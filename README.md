# Rails2Ext

This gem is intended to collect all sort of **Rails 2.3.x** extensions that are not (yet?) present in the official repo.
Its structure mimic the original gems structure, so developers should feel at home browsing/extending it.
There is not much right now, but it could grow in size.

# Tests

Run

    rake

to run the rspec test suite.
